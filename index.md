I am an economist at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have 9+ years of experience in development and humanitarian contexts as management consultant, project manager, and researcher. 

I completed my Dual M.A. in Economics/ International Political Economy & Development, from Fordham University, New York City under Foreign Fulbright Student Fellowship. 

My current research focuses on generating comparable socioeconomic statistics for forcibly displaced population, most notably, the Rohingya refugee population.
