title: "Daily updating dashboard on Russian defense losses"
---

The Russia-Ukraine crisis of 2022 has seen more citizen journalism than conflicts in the decades past. Given the rich pipeline of data coming in, Kaggle user [Petro](https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm) created a daily (now weekly) updating dataset that collates Russian defense losses across all weapon categories. I connected to his data pipeline to create a dashboard that lives on Kaggle, and produces updated line charts of defense losses by category every 24 hours. 

You can view the daily updating notebook on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/masudrahman19/visualizing-russian-defense-loss-in-ukraine-2022/notebook).

The following is a screengrab from the notebook's output as of 22nd August 2023.
