summary: 'This JDC Digest explores the impacts of forced displacement on host communities in the EHAGL region, as well as opportunities to facilitate opportunities for refugees and other forcibly displaced persons through mobility, assistance and inclusion into national services. Our review unveils how refugee presence can spur development and enhance service infrastructure while reshaping local labor dynamics. Central to our findings is the crucial role of refugee self-reliance and mobility in fostering economic and social integration. However, the review also underscores the need for further research, particularly regarding the inclusion of refugees into national systems and the specific challenges facing returnees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Offering a comprehensive view, this Digest aims to inform balanced policy decisions in the region.'}

summary: 'Bangladesh hosts about a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with limited economic opportunities. Humanitarian aid includes cash-for-work and refugee volunteer programmes, providing essential stipends. A UNHCR-Yale survey shows these are the main income sources in camps. Despite earning more, refugee incomes remain below the minimum expenditure basket, with 63% of households having unmet needs and 82% unable to afford critical expenses like food, clothing, and healthcare. Only 10% of households save income, and 38% donate, mainly through religious offerings.'}
